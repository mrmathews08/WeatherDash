## Description 

This is a weather application that diplays current weather and a 5 day forecast for a specified city. 
The weather information displayed includes the date, the temperature, and the humidity.
In addition, the future weather cards display an icon for what weather can be expected. 


In the current weather element, in addition to that information, the current wind speed will be displayed. 

City searches will also be stored in the drop down and the LAST city searched will be displayed when returning to the page.
